# DataCamp_Python_Data_Scientist_Certificate
This repository possesses all the courses associated with the Data Scientist certificate, some of the coding exams are posted on my account in other repositories. 
However, the courses and all certificates are located in this repo. The objective of the course for the Data Scientist with Python certificate is as follows:
"Learn Python for data science and gain the career-building skills you need to succeed as a data scientist, from data manipulation to machine learning!

In this track, you’ll learn how this versatile language allows you to import, clean, manipulate, and visualize data—all integral skills for any 
aspiring data professional or researcher.

Starting with the Python essentials for data science, you’ll work through interactive exercises that test your abilities. 
You’ll get hands-on with some of the most popular Python libraries for data science, including pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, and many more.

As you progress, you’ll work with real-world datasets to learn the statistical and machine learning techniques you need to perform hypothesis testing and build predictive models. 
You’ll also get an introduction to supervised learning with scikit-learn and apply your skills to various projects.

Start this track, grow your data science skills, and begin your journey to becoming a confident data scientist with Python."
